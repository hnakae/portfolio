              Hey everyone, I'm Hiro and you've found my site. <br>
              This is a collection of projects, documents, social <br>
              media channels and whatever else I feel like putting on here.<br>
              Currently, I'm set on finishing this portfolio site by July 31st, <br>
              so that I can start freelancing while I work on <br>
              getting my bachelors in computer science.
