      Hey everyone, I'm Hiro and you've found my site. <br>
      This is a collection of projects, documents, social <br>
      media channels and whatever else I feel like putting on here.<br>
      Currently, I'm set on finishing this portfolio site by July 31st, <br>
      so that I can start freelancing while I work on <br>
      getting my bachelors in computer science from UofO. <br>
    </p><br>
